            <h1>Hi , I'm kaleab teklemariam</h1>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student at american collage of technology with a focus on building functional, scalable software that solves everyday problems. My technical foundation spans full-stack development and systems architecture, with hands-on experience in languages like Python and Java. I thrive on the challenge of taking a project from a whiteboard concept to a deployed application, whether that’s a data-driven web app or an automated script to streamline a workflow. Beyond just writing clean code, I’m committed to continuous learning and enjoy collaborating on teams that value efficiency, clear documentation, and user-centric design..</p>

            <h2>PLANS<h2>
                <p>As a Computer Science student in 2026, my goal is to evolve from a traditional coder into a high-level AI-augmented engineer who treats AI as a powerful collaborator rather than a crutch. I am focusing on mastering "vibe coding" and agentic workflows to build complex applications at speed, while simultaneously diving deep into low-level systems like networking, security, and systems architecture so I can troubleshoot the complex hallucinations AI inevitably creates.<p>

                <h2>GOALS<h2>
                    <p>Once I finish my classes, my goal is to transition from a student to a High-Impact Systems Architect by focusing on the structural and foundational side of technology. I plan to secure a role in Cloud Architecture or Systems Engineering, moving away from just "writing code" to designing the large-scale environments that apps run on.<p>
